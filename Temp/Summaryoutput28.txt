One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August s raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible administration officials now acknowledge
I either heard these statements myself the source said or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members The government has also said in other court papers that the source helped identify bin Laden s signature on a document urging Muslims to kill Americans
The source described taking an oath of allegiance to follow bin Laden s orders and gave a detailed account of bin Laden s group including its history and inner workings
He bought the Shifa plant in March
